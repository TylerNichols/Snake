# Snake
A snake game written in Racket with beginners in mind


Some musings are contained along with the code that will late be combined to create a simple tutorial. 


# TODO
Fix bug where it is possible to move twice in one tick causing snake to hit itself
(Can use some global lock or just store it in the snake like the snake part buffer)
